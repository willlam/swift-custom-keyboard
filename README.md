# swift custom keyboard

A quick project so I can get the ropes of playing around with custom keyboards. I noticed that I was using the "¯\_(ツ)_/¯" Japanese emoticon a fair bit, and didn't like having to open up notepad over and over to copy and paste it. I figure the best way to go about implementing it was to build a keyboard. This is especially after learning about the "Hodor" keyboard. you can probably guess as to what it does.

Admittedly, it took a bit longer than I should have because I am a fair bit rusty with Swift after shelving the learning for a little while due to work. Now that things have freed up. I decided to build this.. it's still a work in progress and will be learning Sketch and stuff and hopefully I have something viable to ship to the app store :)
